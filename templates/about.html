    <p>
        I am a third-year student at the University of the West Indies, Mona, majoring in Computer Science. I am 
        a 21-year-old Jamaican citizen who likes to read, write, code, and listen to music. I am also a budding 
        developer. My interest in Web Development was something that came with being interested in Computer 
        Science. However, Web Development became an actual professional goal of mine over the summer break og 2022
        when I decided to create a Web Development project with the help of articles and videos on the internet. I 
        enjoyed the experience a lot, and now, along with Cybersecurity, Web Development is a career path I am 
        determined to take.
